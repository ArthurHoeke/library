Two type of parachain slots exist on Rococo: Long Lasting\nslots and Short term slots. As long as a project has a parachain on either Kusama or\nPolkadot, they are entitled to having a parachain on Rococo, running besides it.\nThis allows for all production chains to have a testing bed, as well as to onboard\nthe projects working on their chains. If a project does not have a production parachain,\nthen they will be assigned a short lease slot, which allows them to test the parachain\nfunctionality and still give room for everyone to test out\n","Rococo does not replace local testing for projects. This is always encourage for fast\niterations and comprehensive testing for teams. In Rococo teams should test more\ncross-chain functionality with other teams, and allow developers to test the\ninfrastructure as well\n"]}
